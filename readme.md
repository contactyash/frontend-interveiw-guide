(need to add resources for problem solving)

for below mentioned topics I will try to write blogs posts on each of them( probaby two in a week).

## How Browser works

- V8 - conversion of JS to assembly and optimizations
- HTTP
- HTML parsing to painting pixels, how it interperts different resources, render blocking resources, [Layout Thrashing](https://gist.github.com/paulirish/5d52fb081b3570c81e3a)
